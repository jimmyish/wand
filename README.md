# WANd - Wide Area Network Daemon

This project built a virtual Ethernet WAN overlay network. It was designed to
act as a virtual Ethernet exchange to permit multiple private networks to
communicate directly, bypassing NAT issues etc.

This project has been abandoned for many years - it is here simply to preserve
history. This code is **not** supposed to be used in production (or in fact, in
any way!).
